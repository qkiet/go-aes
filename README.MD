# Introduction
This is my personal project that I want to implement a simple, not optimized, from-spec AES encryption and decryption. Please use for educational purpose, not for commercial usage!
# Potential roadmap
This is roadmap for this project:
- Support AES-192, AES-256
- Maybe, do a more advanced and secured implementation
- Add benchmark between AES implementation
